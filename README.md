This code powers a particle argon microcontroller. 
The project aims to keep count of how many people are in a space in order to 
adhere to a building's capacity. 

A unique add on feature, is air quality monitoring through an Adafruit dashboard
and allows for automatic and manual plant watering. 

### **Specifics**
1. **People Count and Capacity Alarm**
  * *By utilizing a switch case machine & 2 lasers and 2 photoresistors (and a mirror)* 
    *this code accomplishes the goal of counting people who pass inside, and subtracts*
    *from the count as people leave.*
  * *Once capacity is hit, the neoPixels at the top the tower turn from green to red*
    *When space opens up, the neoPixels will turn back to green to visibly show there
    *is now space in the building.*
  * *This data is published to the adafruit dashboard with a timestamp.*

2. **AirQuality Monitoring**
  * *The airquality sensor and CO2 sensor provide data that can assess the air of a space.*
  * *Actions can be taken to improve the indoor airquality for a healthier indoor space*

3. **Plant Watering**
  * *Automatic watering system based on soil moisture readings*
  * *Manual dashboard plant watering button*

### **Components Parts and Items Used** 
* *Hinges and door knob*
* *Wood*
* *Plants*
* *Tubing*
* *Wires*
* *Screws*
* *Air Quality Sensor*
* *CO2 Sensor*
* *Capacitive Soil Sensor*
* *Lasers*
* *Water Pump*
* *Relay*
* *Photo Resistors*
* *10 Ohm Resistor (10)*
* *200 Ohm Resistor (2)*
* *2k Resistor*
* *Transistor*
* *NeoPixels*
